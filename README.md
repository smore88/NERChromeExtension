# NERChromeExtension
Built an NER Chrome Extension that highlights all named entities on a webpage using a convolutional neural networking model that I trained with a kaggle NER dataset I found online.

README is under the works still....However to view the code please navigate to the myNER folder and for my Django server settings navigate to the mySite folder.
